# Mental Health Tracker

Mental health awareness has evolved significantly over the years. What was once dismissed or misunderstood has now become recognized as an essential part of overall well-being. With this growing awareness have come new approaches to managing internal struggles and emotional pain.

Ironically, while technology and social media have made us more connected than ever, many people still experience loneliness and isolation. These feelings continue to contribute to the rise of mental health challenges in today’s society.

In my research, I found a lack of interactive, online tools that allow individuals to document their mental health journey—spaces to reflect, process emotions, and track daily moods in a meaningful way.

To address this gap, I created a website designed to help users record their personal experiences with mental health. The goal is to encourage self-reflection, foster emotional awareness, and ultimately support self-improvement through consistent journaling and mood tracking.
